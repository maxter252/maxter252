## Overview of My Projects

1) Sir-Barry - Sir Barry is a virtual assistant that can assist with some day to day tasks, the source code can be used as a starting point for building virtual assistants with Google's Dialogflow. Sir Bary was built to address some of the features that i thought would be useful additions to google assistant, and also as a point of amusment to show friends. 

2) Apache Beam Python Starter - Coming Soon...
